# Build your first basic machine learning app
Code resources and instructiions for Central London Data Science Project Nights 22nd meetup.

## First off!
Make sure you've got [Annaconda Navigator](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed, this will allow you to use Jupyter Notebooks and easily managed you installed libraries.

Then you need to creaet an account with the internet server hosting service we will be using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host our app, it's free and by far the easiest web server hosting service for this sort of thing!

## The Task
We have provided a starter notebook that will guide you in making a simple machine learning model for predicting Titanic survivors. Along side that is a finnished solution notebook incase you get stuck on any part.

After you have built a simple model, you then need to save it (i.e. pickel it!). You can then copy that trained model file onto our server and use it in a little web app (using the Flask library).

The web app will return to the user a simple web form, and when the user has entered all the data and submited the form, the user will then be told whether they are or are not likly to survive on the Titanic.
